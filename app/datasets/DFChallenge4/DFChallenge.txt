2- How many users has the attacker(s) added to the box, and how were they added?

4- What software has been installed on the box, and were they installed by the attacker(s) or not?
5- Using memory forensics, can you identify the type of shellcode used?
6- What is the timeline analysis for all events that happened on the box?
